\item 0.\+5.\+0 (2012/03/04)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item New Feature -\/ {\ttfamily nue.\+as} function is introduced to map asynchronous callback arguments to next function ones.
\item Change -\/ in a step function, {\ttfamily this.\+async} accepts arguments mapping definition to pass callback arguments to a next function.
\item Change -\/ in a step function, {\ttfamily this.\+for\+Each} function is removed and {\ttfamily this.\+async\+Each} is added instead.
\item Change -\/ in a step function, {\ttfamily this.\+args} property is removed.

\item 0.\+4.\+0 (2012/02/27)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item New Feature -\/ {\ttfamily nue.\+parallel} is available to execute some steps in parallel.
\item New Feature -\/ in a step function, {\ttfamily this.\+for\+Each} function is available to execute a provided function once per array element in parallel.
\item New Feature -\/ in a step function, {\ttfamily this.\+exec} function is available to execute a step asynchronously.
\item New Feature -\/ in a step function, {\ttfamily this.\+history} property is available to contain information about executed steps (E\+X\+P\+E\+R\+I\+M\+E\+N\+T\+A\+L).

\item 0.\+3.\+0 (2012/02/25)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item New Feature -\/ in a step function, {\ttfamily this.\+end\+With} is available to end a control-\/flow with an error.
\item Change -\/ {\ttfamily arguments} for an async callback are grouped by each {\ttfamily this.\+async} call.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 0.\+2.\+0 (2012/02/23)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item New Feature -\/ an error passed to async callback is notified with Nue\+Async\+Error to make debug easy
\item New Feature -\/ an unhandled error is notified with Nue\+Unhandled\+Error to make debug easy
\item New Feature -\/ supported to name a flow
\item New Feature -\/ in a step function, {\ttfamily this.\+flow\+Name} is available.
\item New Feature -\/ in a step function, {\ttfamily this.\+step\+Name} is available.
\item Change -\/ in a step function, {\ttfamily this.\+end} doesn\textquotesingle{}t accept an error object as first argument. To end a flow with an error, {\ttfamily throw} the error.
