\subsubsection*{Run them yourself}

node-\/uuid comes with some benchmarks to measure performance of generating U\+U\+I\+Ds. These can be run using node.\+js. node-\/uuid is being benchmarked against some other uuid modules, that are available through npm namely {\ttfamily uuid} and {\ttfamily uuid-\/js}.

To prepare and run the benchmark issue;


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 npm install uuid uuid-js
2 node benchmark/benchmark.js
\end{DoxyCode}


You\textquotesingle{}ll see an output like this one\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 # v4
2 nodeuuid.v4(): 854700 uuids/second
3 nodeuuid.v4('binary'): 788643 uuids/second
4 nodeuuid.v4('binary', buffer): 1336898 uuids/second
5 uuid(): 479386 uuids/second
6 uuid('binary'): 582072 uuids/second
7 uuidjs.create(4): 312304 uuids/second
8 
9 # v1
10 nodeuuid.v1(): 938086 uuids/second
11 nodeuuid.v1('binary'): 683060 uuids/second
12 nodeuuid.v1('binary', buffer): 1644736 uuids/second
13 uuidjs.create(1): 190621 uuids/second
\end{DoxyCode}



\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The {\ttfamily uuid()} entries are for Nikhil Marathe\textquotesingle{}s \href{https://bitbucket.org/nikhilm/uuidjs}{\tt uuid module} which is a wrapper around the native libuuid library.
\item The {\ttfamily uuidjs()} entries are for Patrick Negri\textquotesingle{}s \href{https://github.com/pnegri/uuid-js}{\tt uuid-\/js module} which is a pure javascript implementation based on \href{https://github.com/LiosK/UUID.js}{\tt U\+U\+I\+D.\+js} by Lios\+K.
\end{DoxyItemize}

If you want to get more reliable results you can run the benchmark multiple times and write the output into a log file\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 for i in \{0..9\}; do node benchmark/benchmark.js >> benchmark/bench\_0.4.12.log; done;
\end{DoxyCode}


If you\textquotesingle{}re interested in how performance varies between different node versions, you can issue the above command multiple times.

You can then use the shell script {\ttfamily bench.\+sh} provided in this directory to calculate the averages over all benchmark runs and draw a nice plot\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 (cd benchmark/ && ./bench.sh)
\end{DoxyCode}


This assumes you have \href{http://www.gnuplot.info/}{\tt gnuplot} and \href{http://www.imagemagick.org/}{\tt Image\+Magick} installed. You\textquotesingle{}ll find a nice {\ttfamily bench.\+png} graph in the {\ttfamily benchmark/} directory then.
