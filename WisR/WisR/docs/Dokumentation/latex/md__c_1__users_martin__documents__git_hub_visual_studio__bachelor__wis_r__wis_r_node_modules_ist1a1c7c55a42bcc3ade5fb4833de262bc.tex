\section*{Handlebars.\+js }

Handlebars.\+js is an extension to the \href{http://mustache.github.com/}{\tt Mustache templating language} created by Chris Wanstrath. Handlebars.\+js and Mustache are both logicless templating languages that keep the view and the code separated like we all know they should be.

Checkout the official Handlebars docs site at \href{http://www.handlebarsjs.com}{\tt http\+://www.\+handlebarsjs.\+com} and the live demo at \href{http://tryhandlebarsjs.com/}{\tt http\+://tryhandlebarsjs.\+com/}.

\subsection*{Installing }

See our \href{http://handlebarsjs.com/installation.html}{\tt installation documentation}.

\subsection*{Usage }

In general, the syntax of Handlebars.\+js templates is a superset of Mustache templates. For basic syntax, check out the \href{http://mustache.github.com/mustache.5.html}{\tt Mustache manpage}.

Once you have a template, use the {\ttfamily Handlebars.\+compile} method to compile the template into a function. The generated function takes a context argument, which will be used to render the template.


\begin{DoxyCode}
var source = \textcolor{stringliteral}{"<p>Hello, my name is \{\{name\}\}. I am from \{\{hometown\}\}. I have "} +
             \textcolor{stringliteral}{"\{\{kids.length\}\} kids:</p>"} +
             \textcolor{stringliteral}{"<ul>\{\{#kids\}\}<li>\{\{name\}\} is \{\{age\}\}</li>\{\{/kids\}\}</ul>"};
var \textcolor{keyword}{template} = Handlebars.compile(source);

var data = \{ \textcolor{stringliteral}{"name"}: \textcolor{stringliteral}{"Alan"}, \textcolor{stringliteral}{"hometown"}: \textcolor{stringliteral}{"Somewhere, TX"},
             \textcolor{stringliteral}{"kids"}: [\{\textcolor{stringliteral}{"name"}: \textcolor{stringliteral}{"Jimmy"}, \textcolor{stringliteral}{"age"}: \textcolor{stringliteral}{"12"}\}, \{\textcolor{stringliteral}{"name"}: \textcolor{stringliteral}{"Sally"}, \textcolor{stringliteral}{"age"}: \textcolor{stringliteral}{"4"}\}]\};
var result = \textcolor{keyword}{template}(data);

\textcolor{comment}{// Would render:}
\textcolor{comment}{// <p>Hello, my name is Alan. I am from Somewhere, TX. I have 2 kids:</p>}
\textcolor{comment}{// <ul>}
\textcolor{comment}{//   <li>Jimmy is 12</li>}
\textcolor{comment}{//   <li>Sally is 4</li>}
\textcolor{comment}{// </ul>}
\end{DoxyCode}

\subsection*{Precompiling Templates }

Handlebars allows templates to be precompiled and included as javascript code rather than the handlebars template allowing for faster startup time. Full details are located \href{http://handlebarsjs.com/precompilation.html}{\tt here}.

\subsection*{Differences Between Handlebars.\+js and Mustache }

Handlebars.\+js adds a couple of additional features to make writing templates easier and also changes a tiny detail of how partials work.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{http://handlebarsjs.com/#paths}{\tt Nested Paths}
\item \href{http://handlebarsjs.com/#helpers}{\tt Helpers}
\item \href{http://handlebarsjs.com/#block-expressions}{\tt Block Expressions}
\item \href{http://handlebarsjs.com/#literals}{\tt Literal Values}
\item \href{http://handlebarsjs.com/#comments}{\tt Delimited Comments}
\end{DoxyItemize}

Block expressions have the same syntax as mustache sections but should not be confused with one another. Sections are akin to an implicit {\ttfamily each} or {\ttfamily with} statement depending on the input data and helpers are explicit pieces of code that are free to implement whatever behavior they like. The \href{http://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html}{\tt mustache spec} defines the exact behavior of sections. In the case of name conflicts, helpers are given priority.

\subsubsection*{Compatibility}

There are a few Mustache behaviors that Handlebars does not implement.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Handlebars deviates from Mustache slightly in that it does not perform recursive lookup by default. The compile time {\ttfamily compat} flag must be set to enable this functionality. Users should note that there is a performance cost for enabling this flag. The exact cost varies by template, but it\textquotesingle{}s recommended that performance sensitive operations should avoid this mode and instead opt for explicit path references.
\item The optional Mustache-\/style lambdas are not supported. Instead Handlebars provides its own lambda resolution that follows the behaviors of helpers.
\item Alternative delimiters are not supported.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Supported Environments }

Handlebars has been designed to work in any E\+C\+M\+A\+Script 3 environment. This includes


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Node.\+js
\item Chrome
\item Firefox
\item Safari 5+
\item Opera 11+
\item I\+E 6+
\end{DoxyItemize}

Older versions and other runtimes are likely to work but have not been formally tested. The compiler requires {\ttfamily J\+S\+O\+N.\+stringify} to be implemented natively or via a polyfill. If using the precompiler this is not necessary.

\href{https://saucelabs.com/u/handlebars}{\tt !\mbox{[}Selenium Test Status\mbox{]}(https\+://saucelabs.\+com/browser-\/matrix/handlebars.\+svg)}

\subsection*{Performance }

In a rough performance test, precompiled Handlebars.\+js templates (in the original version of Handlebars.\+js) rendered in about half the time of Mustache templates. It would be a shame if it were any other way, since they were precompiled, but the difference in architecture does have some big performance advantages. Justin Marney, a.\+k.\+a. \href{http://github.com/gotascii}{\tt gotascii}, confirmed that with an \href{http://sorescode.com/2010/09/12/benchmarks.html}{\tt independent test}. The rewritten Handlebars (current version) is faster than the old version, with many \href{https://travis-ci.org/wycats/handlebars.js/builds/33392182#L538}{\tt performance tests} being 5 to 7 times faster than the Mustache equivalent.
