Like {\ttfamily mkdir -\/p}, but in node.\+js!

\href{http://travis-ci.org/substack/node-mkdirp}{\tt !\mbox{[}build status\mbox{]}(https\+://secure.\+travis-\/ci.\+org/substack/node-\/mkdirp.\+png)}

\section*{example}

\subsection*{pow.\+js}


\begin{DoxyCode}
var mkdirp = require(\textcolor{stringliteral}{'mkdirp'});

mkdirp(\textcolor{stringliteral}{'/tmp/foo/bar/baz'}, \textcolor{keyword}{function} (err) \{
    \textcolor{keywordflow}{if} (err) console.error(err)
    \textcolor{keywordflow}{else} console.log(\textcolor{stringliteral}{'pow!'})
\});
\end{DoxyCode}


Output


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 pow!
\end{DoxyCode}


And now /tmp/foo/bar/baz exists, huzzah!

\section*{methods}


\begin{DoxyCode}
var mkdirp = require(\textcolor{stringliteral}{'mkdirp'});
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{mkdirp(dir, opts, cb)}

Create a new directory and any necessary subdirectories at {\ttfamily dir} with octal permission string {\ttfamily opts.\+mode}. If {\ttfamily opts} is a non-\/object, it will be treated as the {\ttfamily opts.\+mode}.

If {\ttfamily opts.\+mode} isn\textquotesingle{}t specified, it defaults to {\ttfamily 0777 \& ($\sim$process.umask())}.

{\ttfamily cb(err, made)} fires with the error or the first directory {\ttfamily made} that had to be created, if any.

You can optionally pass in an alternate {\ttfamily fs} implementation by passing in {\ttfamily opts.\+fs}. Your implementation should have {\ttfamily opts.\+fs.\+mkdir(path, mode, cb)} and {\ttfamily opts.\+fs.\+stat(path, cb)}.

\subsection*{mkdirp.\+sync(dir, opts)}

Synchronously create a new directory and any necessary subdirectories at {\ttfamily dir} with octal permission string {\ttfamily opts.\+mode}. If {\ttfamily opts} is a non-\/object, it will be treated as the {\ttfamily opts.\+mode}.

If {\ttfamily opts.\+mode} isn\textquotesingle{}t specified, it defaults to {\ttfamily 0777 \& ($\sim$process.umask())}.

Returns the first directory that had to be created, if any.

You can optionally pass in an alternate {\ttfamily fs} implementation by passing in {\ttfamily opts.\+fs}. Your implementation should have {\ttfamily opts.\+fs.\+mkdir\+Sync(path, mode)} and {\ttfamily opts.\+fs.\+stat\+Sync(path)}.

\section*{usage}

This package also ships with a {\ttfamily mkdirp} command.


\begin{DoxyCode}

8 OPTIONS are:
9 
10   -m, --mode   If a directory needs to be created, set the mode as an octal
11                permission string.
