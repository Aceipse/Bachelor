\subsection{Detailed Description}
An abstraction for producing coverage reports. This class is both the base class as well as a factory for {\ttfamily \hyperlink{class_report}{Report}} implementations. All reports are event emitters and are expected to emit a {\ttfamily done} event when the report writing is complete.

See also the {\ttfamily \hyperlink{class_reporter}{Reporter}} class for easily producing multiple coverage reports with a single call.

\subsubsection*{Usage }

\begin{DoxyVerb} var Report = require('istanbul').Report,
     report = Report.create('html'),
     collector = new require('istanbul').Collector;

 collector.add(coverageObject);
 report.on('done', function () { console.log('done'); });
 report.writeReport(collector);
\end{DoxyVerb}

\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
