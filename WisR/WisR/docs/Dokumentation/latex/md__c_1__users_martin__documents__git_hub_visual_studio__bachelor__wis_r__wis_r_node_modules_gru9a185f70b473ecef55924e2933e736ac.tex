The config thing npm uses

If you are interested in interacting with the config settings that npm uses, then use this module.

However, if you are writing a new Node.\+js program, and want configuration functionality similar to what npm has, but for your own thing, then I\textquotesingle{}d recommend using \href{https://github.com/dominictarr/rc}{\tt rc}, which is probably what you want.

If I were to do it all over again, that\textquotesingle{}s what I\textquotesingle{}d do for npm. But, alas, there are many systems depending on many of the particulars of npm\textquotesingle{}s configuration setup, so it\textquotesingle{}s not worth the cost of changing.

\begin{DoxyCode}
1 var npmconf = require('npmconf')
2 
3 // pass in the cli options that you read from the cli
4 // or whatever top-level configs you want npm to use for now.
5 npmconf.load(\{some:'configs'\}, function (er, conf) \{
6   // do stuff with conf
7   conf.get('some', 'cli') // 'configs'
8   conf.get('username') // 'joebobwhatevers'
9   conf.set('foo', 'bar', 'user')
10   conf.save('user', function (er) \{
11     // foo = bar is now saved to ~/.npmrc or wherever
12   \})
13 \})
