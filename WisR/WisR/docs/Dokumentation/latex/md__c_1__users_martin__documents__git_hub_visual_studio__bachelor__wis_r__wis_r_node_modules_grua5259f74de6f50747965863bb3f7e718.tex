\subsection*{What?}

Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are given commit-\/access to the project to contribute as they see fit. This project is more like an open wiki than a standard guarded open source project.

\subsection*{Rules}

There are a few basic ground-\/rules for contributors\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\bfseries No {\ttfamily -\/-\/force} pushes} or modifying the Git history in any way.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\bfseries Non-\/master branches} ought to be used for ongoing work.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\bfseries External A\+P\+I changes and significant modifications} ought to be subject to an {\bfseries internal pull-\/request} to solicit feedback from other contributors.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Internal pull-\/requests to solicit feedback are {\itshape encouraged} for any other non-\/trivial contribution but left to the discretion of the contributor.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item For significant changes wait a full 24 hours before merging so that active contributors who are distributed throughout the world have a chance to weigh in.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Contributors should attempt to adhere to the prevailing code-\/style.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\subsection*{Releases}

Declaring formal releases remains the prerogative of the project maintainer.
