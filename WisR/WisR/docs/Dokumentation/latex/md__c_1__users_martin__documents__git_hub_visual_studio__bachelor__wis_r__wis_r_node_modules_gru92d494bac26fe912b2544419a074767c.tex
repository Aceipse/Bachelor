A replacement for process.\+exit that ensures stdio are fully drained before exiting.

To make a long story short, if {\ttfamily process.\+exit} is called on Windows, script output is often truncated when pipe-\/redirecting {\ttfamily stdout} or {\ttfamily stderr}. This module attempts to work around this issue by waiting until those streams have been completely drained before actually calling {\ttfamily process.\+exit}.

See \href{https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/3584}{\tt Node.\+js issue \#3584} for further reference.

Tested in O\+S X 10.\+8, Windows 7 on Node.\+js 0.\+8.\+25 and 0.\+10.\+18.

Based on some code by \href{https://github.com/vladikoff}{\tt }.

\subsection*{Getting Started}

Install the module with\+: {\ttfamily npm install exit}


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 var exit = require('exit');
2 
3 // These lines should appear in the output, EVEN ON WINDOWS.
4 console.log("omg");
5 console.error("yay");
6 
7 // process.exit(5);
8 exit(5);
9 
10 // These lines shouldn't appear in the output.
11 console.log("wtf");
12 console.error("bro");
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{Don\textquotesingle{}t believe me? Try it for yourself.}

In Windows, clone the repo and cd to the {\ttfamily test\textbackslash{}fixtures} directory. The only difference between \href{test/fixtures/log.js}{\tt log.\+js} and \href{test/fixtures/log-broken.js}{\tt log-\/broken.\+js} is that the former uses {\ttfamily exit} while the latter calls {\ttfamily process.\+exit} directly.

This test was done using cmd.\+exe, but you can see the same results using {\ttfamily $\vert$ grep \char`\"{}std\char`\"{}} in either Power\+Shell or git-\/bash.
